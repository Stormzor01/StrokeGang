<P> this page is about my subject called history. I am learning WW1 ( life in the trenches) and The rise of the Nazis. 
IN WW1 many women and children lost men and boys in there family, The men who fought in WW1 fought for their country and for the freedom
of other people.
have i told you about the team called the stroke squad? 
well.... They are legends amongst the best</p>
